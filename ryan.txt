½ cup sugar
3 TBSP Milk

1 tsp. Vanilla

½ cup butter

Instructions
Preheat oven to 350° F (175 degrees C). Place parchment paper on or grease a baking sheet and set aside.
In a small mixing bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt.
With an electric mixer, cream butter. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add egg yolk and vanilla. Mix until well combined.
Add dry mixture and milk alternately, starting and ending with dry.
You should have a dough that is soft but not sticky. Place in fridge for 30-60 minutes.
Remove dough from fridge and roll out to 1/4 inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Use chosen cookie cutters to cut out shapes.
Place shapes on baking pan and bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly browned on edges.
Allow to cool completely before icing.
ICING: Beat butter with an electric mixer. Add powdered sugar and beat until smooth and creamy. Add vanilla. Add milk, a tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.
Spread on cookies, or pipe icing on with a piping bag. Feel free to decorate with sprinkles!

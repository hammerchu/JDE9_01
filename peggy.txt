Grilled Sweet Potatoes Recipe

Ingredients

4 sweet potato
1/4 teaspoon virgin olive oil
For Dressing
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 tablespoon thyme
1 and 3/17 pinch chilli powder
1/2 teaspoon honey

Step 1 Boil the sweet potato
To begin with, put a pressure cooker on high flame and add enough water in it to soak the sweet potatoes. Add the sweet potatoes in the cooker and close the lid. Boil the sweet potatoes for about 2-3 whistles and once done, turn the gas off. Let the steam release on its own, and when done, open the cooker and drain the water. After that, peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into thick round slices.

Step 2 Heat the grill and cook the potato slices
Now, put a grill pan on medium flame and heat virgin olive oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, put the sliced sweet potatoes on the pan in batches and grill until the sweet potatoes become brown in colour from both sides.

Step 3 Prepare the dressing
Now, prepare the lemon-honey dressing and for that, mix together honey, salt, thyme, chilli powder and lemon juice in a deep mixing bowl.

Step 4 Pour the dressing and indulge in the goodness
Take a serving dish, and lay the grilled sweet potatoes slices in it. Pour the lemon-honey dressing all over the grilled sweet potatoes and serve fresh!

1 kg. Chicken wings (cut in half)

1 bottle 300ml coca cola

salt and pepper to season the chicken

3 tbsp. soy sauce

1 tbsp. ginger (minced)

3 cloves garlic (minced)

DIRECTIONS
Clean the chicken wings. Then, season with salt and pepper. Mix well until the wings are well-coated.

In a skillet or pan, put some oil for shallow frying. Put the chicken wings until brown in both sides. Flip halfway to cook evenly.

Once the chicken wings are browned, pour in the Coca cola. Add soy sauce, ginger and garlic. Toss to coat the chicken. Cook in medium heat until the sauce is reduced.

Turn the chicken wings halfway to cook the other side.

Once the sauce is reduced, turn the heat to high to thicken the sauce and becomes glaze. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. The chicken wings would be sticky.

Garnish with chopped green onions or sesame seeds.

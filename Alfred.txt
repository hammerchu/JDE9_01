How to Cook Rice on the StoveRead the back of every rice package in your pantry, and you'll realize that there's no one way to make rice on the stove. The technique changes based on which type of rice you're making. But have no fear, we've broken down everything below.The Classic MethodWhen you think about making rice, this is the technique that probably comes to mind because it's the most classic. It works fantastically with typical long-grain white rice. If you're face-to-face with something like a short-grain rice, you can always check the package instructions for how to tailor this technique to the variety.1. Rinse the rice.2. Use the right ratio of water. Add 2 parts water and 1 part rice to a large pot. For slightly firmer rice, use 1 part liquid to 2/3 parts rice.3. Bring the water to a boil. Once it's boiling, add a big pinch of salt.4. Maintain a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight fitting lid, and maintain a gentle simmer.5. Cook without peeking or stirring. Cook until the water is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Try not to peek until the end of the cooking time so the steam doesn't escape. Whatever you do, don't mix the rice while it's cooking ¡X this will lead to gummy rice.6. Let the rice rest covered. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes. During this time, the rice will steam for extra fluffy results.7. Fluff the rice with a fork.

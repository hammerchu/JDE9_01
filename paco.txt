Ingredients
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces

3 tablespoons butter, melted

1 tablespoon olive oil

1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste

3 cloves garlic, minced

1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon paprika

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) setting  for 5 minutes.

Stir melted butter, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, paprika, and cayenne together in a large bowl. Add chicken pieces, and toss to coat thoroughly. Place chicken pieces in a single layer in the air fryer basket. You may have to cook them in batches.

Air fry in the preheated fryer until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
